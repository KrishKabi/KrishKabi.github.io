Data Science / Analytics Projects

## [Project 1: Instagram Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Instagram%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
Embarked on a comprehensive sentiment analysis project leveraging a dataset comprising 474 rows of Instagram data. Focused on extracting valuable insights from comments and sentiments encapsulated within the "string_map_data.Comment.value" column.

**Key Accomplishments**:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Conducted meticulous data preprocessing, addressing challenges like missing values and transforming lists of words into meaningful strings. Employed NLTK for lemmatization, ensuring refined and meaningful text data.

* **Feature Engineering with TF-IDF**: Leveraged advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques by utilizing TF-IDF vectorization. This transformed raw text into numerical features, capturing the essence and importance of words within the dataset.

* **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Explored the efficacy of four machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Identified Logistic Regression as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 84.8%.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Refined the Logistic Regression model using GridSearchCV to identify optimal hyperparameters, enhancing its predictive capabilities.

**Outcome**:
The culmination of this project is a sentiment analysis model adept at discerning sentiments from Instagram comments. The chosen Logistic Regression model showcases a commendable accuracy of 84.8%, providing a robust framework for understanding the sentiment dynamics within the dataset.

**Technologies Used**: 
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK)

**Future Directions**:
Continuously refine and expand the model, exploring deep learning architectures and ensemble methods for improved accuracy and broader applicability. This project reflects a commitment to leveraging data science techniques for meaningful insights into social media analytics.
