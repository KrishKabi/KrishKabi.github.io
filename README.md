## [Project 1: Email Marketing Campaigns Dashboard](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Email_Marketing_Campaign_Dashboard)

![](/Email_Marketing_Campaign_Dashboard/email_marketing_dashboard.png)

Streamlined a disorganized dataset into a clean dashboard, helping a small marketing firm reduce reporting time by 50%. Data between Jan-Oct 2024.

**Key Insights**:

The total cost of all campaigns was **11,409,000**, resulting in:
* **20,018 clicks** and **58,390 reads**, indicating an average **49.02% read rate**
* **169,860 emails sent**, with **71.35% delivered** and **28.65% failed**

March-July 2024 had the highest amount of reads and clicks whereas Feb recorded the lowest amount.

**Outcome**:
The campaign demonstrated reasonable success with a high delivery rate (>70%) and nearly half of the delivered emails being read. However, focusing on optimizing failed deliveries and improving the click-through rate (CTR) could further enhance campaign ROI.

**Technologies Used**: 
Excel for data analysis, visualization, and KPI calculation

**Future Directions**:
* Improve Delivery Rates: Investigate causes of email failures and enhance delivery strategies
* Optimize Content: Conduct A/B testing on email content to boost click and read rates
* Advanced Segmentation: Target specific customer segments based on performance insights for higher engagement
* Automate Reporting: Build dynamic dashboards to provide real-time updates on campaign metrics

## [Project 2: Tesco Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Tesco_Sales_Dashboard_Power_BI)

Analyzed sample Tesco sales, performance, and customer data between 2011-2014

**Key Insights**:

* **Quarterly Trends**: Generally, as sales increased quarter by quarter, profit increased as well. Quarters where sales and profit are around the same or barely have any discrepancy indicate low marginal profits. Sales and profits peaked in 2014 Quarter 3 with ~250K and ~26K in sales and profits, respectively.

* **Top Sales Categories**: Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture. Technology was highest selling category whereas Office Supplies was most profitable category.

* **Top Sales by Country**: France, Germany, and UK.

**Outcome**:
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard offering insights into my Tesco sample sales data.

**Technologies Used**: 
Power BI

**Future Directions**:
Consider incorporating more recent data to see sales and profit trends over time. Identify whether Tesco become more profitable over time, what seasons or economic events have impacted their sales, identify key customers, etc.

## [Project 3: Spotify Insights](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Spotify_Insights)

![](/Spotify_Insights/Spotify%20Picture.png)

Analyzed my Spotify streaming history data to gain insights into my music listening habits and preferences over time.

**Key Insights**:

* **Monthly Streaming Trends**: Overall streaming activity increased significantly from 2017 to 2024. Peaks in February 2020, November 2021, and July 2022, coincide with specific life events, such as the onset of COVID-19, increased music listening during university breaks, and discovering K-pop while learning Korean. Dips in April 2021, April 2022, and June 2023 align with semester-end academic pressures and increased travel during those specific times.

* **Top Songs and Artists**: BTS dominates the top 10 songs, reflecting a strong influence after starting to learn Korean.

* **Reasons for Starting Songs**: The primary reason for starting a new song is the completion of the previous track (77.3%).

* **Streaming Activity Heatmap**: Streaming is consistent across the week, with no particular day standing out. Peak streaming time is between 6-8 am, aligning with morning routines, commutes, and preparation for the day.

* **Offline Streaming Insights**: The majority of streaming is done online, aligning with expectations.

**Outcome**:
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard offering insights into my Spotify streaming history. Gained a deeper understanding of the impact of life events and preferences on music streaming patterns.

**Technologies Used**: 
Power BI

**Future Directions**:
Consider incorporating sentiment analysis or genre classification for a more detailed understanding of my music preferences. Continuously update the dashboard with new data to track evolving trends and habits over time.

## [Project 4: Instagram Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Instagram%20Sentiment%20Analysis)

![](/Instagram%20Sentiment%20Analysis/Sentiment_Analysis_Photo.png)

Embarked on this project with a desire to understand sentiment patterns in my own Instagram interactions. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, I analyzed 474 comments, implemented advanced data preprocessing, and identified an 84.8% accurate sentiment analysis model.

**Key Accomplishments**:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Conducted meticulous data preprocessing, addressing challenges like missing values and transforming lists of words into meaningful strings. Employed NLTK for lemmatization, ensuring refined and meaningful text data.

* **Feature Engineering with TF-IDF**: Leveraged advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques by utilizing TF-IDF vectorization. This transformed raw text into numerical features, capturing the essence and importance of words within the dataset.

* **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Explored the efficacy of four machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Identified Logistic Regression as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 84.8%.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Refined the Logistic Regression model using GridSearchCV to identify optimal hyperparameters, enhancing its predictive capabilities.

**Outcome**:
The culmination of this project is a sentiment analysis model adept at discerning sentiments from Instagram comments. The chosen Logistic Regression model showcases a commendable accuracy of 84.8%, providing a robust framework for understanding the sentiment dynamics within the dataset.

**Technologies Used**: 
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK)

**Future Directions**:
Continuously refine and expand the model, exploring deep learning architectures and ensemble methods for improved accuracy and broader applicability. This project reflects a commitment to leveraging data science techniques for meaningful insights into social media analytics.

## [Project 5: Home Utilities Savings](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Home_Utilities_Savings)

![](/Home_Utilities_Savings/Correlation%20Heatmap.png)

Motivated by a desire to optimize resource management and reduce utility costs, this project delved into the intricate analysis of 18 months of my families' home utilities data.
