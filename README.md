# Project Portfolio
Data Science / Analytics Projects

## Project 1: Home Utilities Savings
* Preprocessed and transformed 18 months of home utilities data in SQL to prepare for subsequent analysis in Python
* Utilized Python for EDA, identifying monthly trends in electricity and water usage. Visualized patterns and correlations to gain insights.
* Applied Linear and RandomForest Regression for electricity and water usage prediction. Evaluated model performance using key metrics.
* Tuned RandomForest models via Grid Search for optimal performance and conducted feature importance analysis for effective model refinement. Resulted in 209% increase in R-squared value for WaterUsage prediction.
* Concluded by acknowledging the models' predictive capabilities, suggesting potential for enhanced precision with more data and advanced techniques.
