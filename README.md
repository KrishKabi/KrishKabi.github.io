# Project Portfolio
Data Science / Analytics Projects

## Project 1: Instagram Sentiment Analysis
* Utilized a dataset consisting of 474 rows of Instagram data, including comments and sentiments extracted from the "string_map_data.Comment.value" column.
* Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting lists of words to strings, and lemmatization using NLTK.
* Utilized TF-IDF vectorization to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features, capturing the importance of words in the dataset.
* Evaluated four machine learning models for sentiment analysis: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
* Identified the best-performing model as Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 88.4%, using hyperparameters.

## [Project 2: Home Utilities Savings](https://github.com/KrishKabi/KrishKabi.github.io/tree/main/Home_Utilities_Savings)
* Preprocessed and transformed 18 months of home utilities data in SQL to prepare for subsequent analysis in Python
* Utilized Python for EDA, identifying monthly trends in electricity and water usage. Visualized patterns and correlations to gain insights.
* Applied Linear and RandomForest Regression for electricity and water usage prediction. Evaluated model performance using key metrics.
* Tuned RandomForest models via Grid Search for optimal performance and conducted feature importance analysis for effective model refinement. Resulted in 209% increase in R-squared value for WaterUsage prediction.
* Concluded by acknowledging the models' predictive capabilities, suggesting potential for enhanced precision with more data and advanced techniques.
